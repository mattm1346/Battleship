Welcome to Battleships! This is a turn-based tactical game where the objective is to sink your opponent's ships before they sink yours.

# How to Play
1. Place your ships. You will need to place 6 ships in total.

The first ship is a length of 5

The second ship is a length of 4

The third and fourth ships are a length of 3

The fifth and sixth ships are a length of 2

If you place your ships incorrectly, an error message will display and you can try again.

2. The Computer will build its board with the same amount of ships. You then get the first shot.

The board follows a grid from 0 to 99. To shoot, enter a number between 0 and 99 and the board will update with the outcome. For example, let's try shooting at 73

On the image above, the shot at 73 is a miss.

The characters for the actions are:

MISS = x

HIT = o

SINK = O

If you sink a ship, the last character will be 'O' to notify that you have sunk a ship.
